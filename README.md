# picoMIPS

During my Embedded Processors course, I successfully designed and implemented a custom picoMIPS processor
architecture tailored for efficient affine transformations. I thoroughly modified the existing architecture, ran
simulations using ModelSim to validate the components, and optimized the design, reducing the number of ALMs
to 45. The resulting custom picoMIPS processor demonstrated its prowess in executing affine transformations
through rigorous testing, both in simulation and on an FPGA.
